Hello & welcome to my portfolio! This is my first react app 
and I love how it turned out. I commented almost every component
so there is less confusion on what exactly everything does. My file 
structure is very neat and easy to navigate. I have a folder for each page,
a folder for all images, and a folder for frequently used styled components, called Styles.

The only libraries I used were react-router, styled-components, & 
react hook forms(w/ emailjs for backend). I didn't use Gatsby because I
want to be able to build an app from the ground up.

It's deployed through netlify.

Problems; contact form doesn't have the best confirmation system, hamburger menu doesn't 
close on click-off, other than that, this app is incredibly performant, easy-to-use, and has 0 bugs.

Updates; carousel for projects page, using a theme to have DRY code.
